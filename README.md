# SortMySwag

SortMySwag is a final project written by Raven Alexander; it can create QR codes and allow you to upload photos of your beauty products and store them in a digital inventory! You can then use this information to keep track of purchases and other notes. You can compare colors/shades to find a better color match in-store, you can create a wishlist to keep track of items you're after, there are many great possibilities for being able to manage an inventory.
